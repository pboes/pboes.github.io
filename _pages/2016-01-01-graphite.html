<p>I programmed an online tool, "<a href="http://www.scope.ai">Scope</a>", that algorithmically curates news articles for people in such a way that they get a graphical overview over the "thematic landscape" in the news and that suggests news articlesÂ with the idea that following those suggestions lets people most efficiently get a broad overview over the topics of any given pool of news articles.</p>
<p>Over the last two years, Scope has turned into a small Start Up, and we (that is, my partner Christoph and I) have been running pilots in automated newsletter curation with two companies, and also been included in the portfolio of a very young deep tech VC, not to mention that I also serve as a mentor to a team of students at a private university in Berlin that works on a business plan for Scope. These are exciting developments and I try to push them to the extent to which I have time for that next to the doctorate.</p>
<p>The original design of the site came equipped with an intuitive interface and was meant to give you an efficient overview of the current news reporting.</p>
<p>Here are some screen shots:</p>
