<p><strong>Film</strong></p>
<p>I was recently (as of May '19) making a little movie, which ended up being about "Adam lay ibounden", 15th-century macaronic English text about Adam contemplating (or not) what happened in paradise. Here are some screenshots, there might at some point be a very exclusive preview...</p>

<p><strong>Stuff</strong></p>
<p>Some of the random things I keep on building that are also documented:</p>

<p>Guitar Lamp (the thing on the front is meant to be a lung in case you didn't notice...)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Lamp from an umbrella, lots of wire and shells. I thought the contrast was great when I built it. I was always the only one who did...</p>

<p>"The perpetual dialectic". Wittgenstein and Poincare (who was a transcendentalist about mathematics, which is not so well known!) spinning round the clock, statically spiralling towards the ineffable...making this was my reaction to a friend telling me that "in order to improve your relationship to yourself you need to first improve your relationship with your room"</p>

<p>These two lovely tiles always accompany me, in memory of my time in London. Love to Elle and Beili.</p>
<p><strong>Christmas Presents</strong></p>
<p>I really like to be creative about my Christmas presents (at least that was before I started getting paid...). The most proud I am still about the "match the belly of your reindeer earrings to your mood"-system that I gave my elder sister once, but unfortunately no evidence survives.</p>

<p>One year I recorded a 1-hour screencast lecture in which I tried to explain the importance of gauge symmetries in the Standard Model to my family. Cover and thumbnails.</p>

<p>Another year I made a "create a Xmas jingle from your name" that created what I would euphemistically call a "soundscape", based on "Jingle Bells".</p>
<p><strong>For friends abroad: The view from my current room, I'm even taking care of some plants! Loving it!</strong></p>
