<p>tl;dr:</p>
<p>Francis Fukuyama, in his famous XXXX text "The end of history", argued that it is important to appreciate ideologies of agents to understand why they behave how they behave.</p>
<p>Establish that there is a problem: THere are lots of articles being published, many of them are rarely ever cited (reference), there is a problem with the replication crisis, there is the question how much bang for buck we are producing, there is the EMOORe's law, there are problems with predatory publishing. On the other hand, scientists notoriously feel under pressure to produce output etc..</p>
<p>The basic argument of this article is very simple: We need scientists to spend more time on curating existing knowledge, making it available to others, etc. Not only because there are probably a lot of hidden gems that, with hidnsight, we will think we were blind not to see. But more importantly because damage is growing exponentially, we need to create a culture of curating, "slow-research". Lets put more efforts in avoiding duplicates: There are many great scripts that are being passed around, still professors all over the place stand under pressure to produce more output.</p>
<p>One can take measures to avoid that, but really the problem goes much deeper: We need to change what we think makes for a good scientist.</p>
<p>Find quotes in which people describe the purpose of a science in 19th century as some kind of genius: You want to have genius insights and communicate them. The librarians and people working in the archives are those that digest the output coming out of the great professor's mind. Advancing on the academic career ladder means being allowed to hand the archival tasks to others. WHile this may be alright, it perpetuates an idea.</p>
<p>This is obvious in disciplines like computer science, where a great amount of efforts goes into curating ideas, making sure others can build on them out of the box. But why is that, compared with biology?</p>
<p>There is also an interesting further aspect here: That too much weight can be given to the opinion of individuals when they are regarded as some kind of "genius scientist"</p>
<p>http://theconversation.com/myth-of-the-genius-solitary-scientist-is-dangerous-87835</p>
<p>There is also a danger of a "Middle Ages" effect, in which anything from the pre-digitized age is effectively lost and has to be derived again (at least in mathematics, this may partly be the case)</p>
<p>Finish this post with a number of ideas about how to solve some of these problems:</p>
<ol>
<li>Allow lecturers to fork their version of a course</li>
<li>
<p>A crowd-sourced database of mathematical identities (asking researchers to confirm best guesses by a machine-learned database)</p>
</li>
</ol>
