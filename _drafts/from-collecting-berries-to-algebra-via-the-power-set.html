<p>Talk about how the starting with a container and objects and considering the simple operation of removing or adding objects one at a time you can get to lattices, Boolean algebras, groups, rings. And how the universality of the process of operating with containers and removing stuff invites arriving at the same kind of logic despite this being, fundamentally, a social construct. Maybe also talk about Peter Damerow and the mental models of early mathematics.</p>
